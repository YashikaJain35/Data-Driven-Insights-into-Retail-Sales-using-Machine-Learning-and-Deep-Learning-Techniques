# Data-Driven Insights into Retail Sales: Forecasting with Seasonal Trends and Marketing Analysis using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

The Data-Driven Insights into Retail Sales project utilizes a variety of machine learning models—including Apriori, association rules, KMeans, PCA, SVR, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor, and Linear Regression—to forecast demand, identify high-frequency product pairings, and uncover seasonal trends. By analyzing attributes like Year, Month, Supplier, Item Code, Retail Sales, and Warehouse Sales, the project provides actionable insights for inventory optimization, targeted marketing, and improved sales strategies. This approach enables retailers to make data-informed decisions, reduce stockouts, enhance promotional planning, and drive revenue growth.
